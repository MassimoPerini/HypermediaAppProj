    "description": "A coronary computed tomography angiogram (CTA) uses advanced CT technology, along with intravenous (IV) contrast material (dye), to obtain high-resolution, 3D pictures of the moving heart and great vessels.CTA is also called multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT), cardiac CT or cardiac CAT. During CTA, x-rays pass through the body and are picked up by detectors in the scanner, that produce 3D images on a computer screen. These images enable physicians to determine whether plaque or calcium deposits are present in the artery walls.CTA is used as a noninvasive method for detecting blockages in the coronary arteries. A CTA can be performed much faster (in less than one minute) than a cardiac catheterization, with potentially less risk and discomfort as well as decreased recovery time.",

    "name": "Laser Vision Correction",
    "description": "Clear vision is an essential part of our daily lives. Clear vision depends on how light rays are focused inside the eye. Normally, light is focused sharply on the retina, allowing the eye to see clearly at all distances. With refractive disorders, the eye’s shape is disproportionate, causing light to focus in front of or behind the retina. This refractive condition causes objects seen with the eye to appear blurry. By correcting your visual problems in the eye itself instead of relying on glasses or contact lenses, laser vision correction surgery provides hassle-free normal or near-normal vision for many patients.",

    "description": "The eye allows us to see by capturing the light rays that are reflected off an object. These light rays are focused upside-down on the retina where they are converted into electrical impulses and carried to the brain. The brain translates the image into its upright position. For those suffering from vision problems such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism and presbyopia, eyeglasses and/or contacts may be a solution. These help to correct vision by focusing light more appropriately on the retina.",

It begins the process of seeing by focusing onto the retina the light that it receives. There are five layers to the cornea, each with a distinct function: epithelium, Bowman’s membrane, stroma, Descemet’s membrane and endothelium.",
