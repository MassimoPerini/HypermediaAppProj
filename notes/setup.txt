===== DB SETUP =====

To use the DB, first install Postgres locally
For MAC, I use https://postgresapp.com
For Windows, I did not test it, but https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/

To visualize data on MAC I use https://eggerapps.at/postico/

Once the DB is up and running, create a table named "hyp_cdm" using graphic tools (postico) or CLI command
> CREATE DATABASE hyp_cdm;

The data to fill the db with is contained in the "data" folder, in the different JSONs.
To init the DB and load this data run

> npm run dbinit

Now the DB is completely functional locally.

===== RECOMMENDED ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE =====

- Postman Chrome extension, API client
